## About Me

I’m a fourth‑year undergraduate at Zhejiang University advised by [Prof. Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/). Currently, I am a research intern at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/), [Prof. Brandon Y. Feng](https://brandonyfeng.github.io/), and [Prof. Chandrajit Bajaj](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bajaj/cvc/index.shtml). Previously, I exchanged at the University of Toronto and worked with [Prof. Lüder Kahrs](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/math-cs-stats/people/lueder-kahrs). 


## Research Interests

Broadly, my research sits at the intersection of Computer Vision and Physical Understanding. I study how AI systems can learn different physical properties from the natural world, and how different visual representations expose different physical information. My work aims to answer these questions.
